    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm Jose Claudio B Bereber, a technology enthusiast with a strong focus on software. Currently, I'm
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at STI College Munoz EDSA, where I'm diving deep into
        the world of technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Education-wise, I'm an undergrad, but let's save the complete details for my webpage. I can proudly say that I'm
        passionate about all things tech, and my expertise lies in handling various technologies, particularly in the
        realm of software.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of my proudest achievements so far was graduating from senior high school with an Academic Excellence Award.
        It's great to be recognized for hard work and dedication.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before diving into my studies full-time, I had a taste of the working world as a Customer Service
        Representative. This experience taught me invaluable skills, such as time management and thriving under
        pressure. It really shaped me into the efficient and focused individual I am today.
        <br>
        <br>
        When it comes to problem-solving, I firmly believe that there's always a solution, no matter how impossible it
        may seem. I approach challenges with determination and a positive mindset, knowing that every obstacle is an
        opportunity for growth and innovation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although I haven't had any major projects yet, I'm excited about what lies ahead. I'm eager to contribute my
        skills and knowledge to the world of technology, making a positive impact wherever I can.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a few hobbies that keep me balanced. I enjoy watching anime and movies,
        playing games, and hitting the basketball court. These activities help me unwind and tap into my creative side.
        <br>
        <br>
        Stay tuned as I continue my journey in the tech world. I'm determined to make my mark and look forward to
        sharing my upcoming projects and contributions with you.</p>
